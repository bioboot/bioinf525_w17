<br>
Bioinformatics - the application of computational and analytical methods to biological problems - is a rapidly maturing field that is driving the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the avalanche of data in modern life sciences and medical research. 

<br>
**Description**: *Foundations of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology* (BIOINF524/525) provides an introduction to the principles and practical approaches of bioinformatics as applied to genes and proteins.

The complete course is comprised of three modules covering (1) [**Foundations of Bioinformatics**]({{ site.baseurl }}/module1/); (2) [**Statistics in Bioinformatics**]({{ site.baseurl }}/module2/); and (3) [**Systems Biology**]({{ site.baseurl }}/module3/).  Students may register for all modules as a single three credit course (under course code BIOINF524), or each one credit module separately (under course code BIOINF525).

	Module 1: 	 January 10 – February 2 	(four lectures and four labs).
	Module 2: 	 February 7 – March 16 		(five lectures and five labs).
	Module 3: 	 March 21 – April 13 		(four lectures and four labs).

<br>
**Schedule**:  One Tuesday lecture and one Thursday lab session per week.  A detailed **syllabus** with topic outlines is available for [**download**]({{ site.baseurl }}/class-material/BIOINF525W17-syllabus.pdf).

	Lectures:	 Tuesdays 2:30 - 4:00 PM, Rm. 2062 Palmer Commons Bldg. 
	Labs:		 Thursdays 2:30 – 4:00 PM Rm. 2062 Palmer Commons Bldg. 

<br>
**Prerequisites**: A familiarity with basic biomedical concepts and basic knowledge of computer usage.  No programing skills are needed. 

<br>
**Requirements**: Students MUST bring their own WiFi enabled laptop to lectures to fully benefit from the highly hands-on nature of each lecture and lab session.  Please see our [**laptop setup instructions**]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup/) for further details. 

<br>
**Objectives**:
Students completing this course will be able to apply leading bioinformatics tools and statistical techniques to address biological questions.  Students will also obtain fundamental R programming skills necessary for analyzing data in the life sciences.  Our broader goal is to point towards perspectives that bioinformatics can expose for the integration and analysis of complex biological information.

<br>
**Grading**: 
Satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading will be based on a combination of lecture and lab involvement together with weekly homework and quiz assignment performance.

<br>
**Why take this course?**: Praise for the 2015 class from [**official student evaluations**]({{ site.baseurl }}/praise/).
