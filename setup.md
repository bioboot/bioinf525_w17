# Software Requirements & Setup Instructions
To fully participate in this course you will need access to the free open source software described below on *your own laptop* (**N.B.** You may need _Administer privileges/permissions_ to install some of these). 

<br>

**Supported web browser**
We require an up-to-date web browser (current versions of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) and [Safari](Safari) are preferred). 

<br>

**R and RStudio:**
Module 2 will use R in order to demonstrate data analyses. R can be downloaded and installed from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html) (Comprehensive R Archive Network). If possible download the latest version of R. As of course launch (Jan 17) the latest release (2016-10-31, Sincere Pumpkin Patch) is R-3.3.2.

We recommend using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) desktop, a slick visual interface for R.

Note that we use R in this course for several reasons:

- R is open-source and freely available for Mac, PC, and Linux machines. This means that there is no restriction on having to license a particular software program, or have students work in a specific lab that has been outfitted with the technology of choice. 
- R is user-extensible and user extensions can easily be made available to others. 
- R is commercial quality. It is the package of choice for many statisticians and those who use statistics frequently. 
- R is very popular in the field of bioinformatics, especially in certain sub-disciplines, like genomics and structural bioinformatics.  
- R is very powerful. Furthermore, it is gaining new features every day. New statistical methods are often available first in R.
