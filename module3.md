# Module 3. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology

Computational analysis of biological networks, OMICs data (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics).  Application of advanced analysis and modeling approaches to study pathways and networks. Emphasis on using existing high throughput data sets alongside newly generated data to analyze and interpret research findings.
